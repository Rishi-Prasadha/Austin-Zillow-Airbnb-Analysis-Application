# Austin Zillow/Airbnb Analysis Application

This application starts off by analyzing Airbnb. We look at what areas of Austin seem to do the best for Airbnb. We look at the average pricing to determine that. We are also using the Zillow data from 2010 to predict the housing market with the upcoming recession. Then, we compare with houses for sale on Zillow to match houses that an investor could buy to rent as an Airbnb for profit.
