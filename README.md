# Austin Zillow/Airbnb Analysis Application

This application starts off by analyzing Zillow data. We begin by training a linear regression model on the Great Recession of 2007-2009 to determine if we are capable of building an application that can help real estate investors decide to either purchase or wait to purchase propwerty in Austin. We then look at what areas of Austin seem to do the best for Airbnb. We look at the average pricing to determine that. Although our Zillow linear regression models were less than satisfactory; using the Airbnb data we were still able to make recommendations on which zip codes are currently best to invest in for prospective real estate investors.
